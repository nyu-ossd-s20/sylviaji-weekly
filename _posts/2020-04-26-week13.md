## Lemmy
For the past week I’ve been reading the Rust documentation and the source code of Lemmy trying to figure out how should I contribute to the code. But in this week’s lecture Joanna mentioned that in the past some students made the mistake of trying to understand the whole code base (which is not very possible). So I decided to start writing some actual code instead of staring at someone else’s code aimlessly all day long. I thought it wouldn’t be too hard to get the issue I’ve been looking at resolved; turned out I was naive. Unfortunately I ran into a huge blocker at step 1: set up the docker development environment. I kept running into the following error: 

![docker](../images/docker.png)

I spent like a whole day trying to fix this (by googling) but so far none of the solutions I found online worked. I’ve been stuck in the infinite loop of : 1. copy & paste the error message and google; 2. try the solution found; 3. try to build again and wait forever; 4. build fails at the exact same place, which has been really frustrating for me. I’m planning to open an issue soon and hope someone in the community can offer some much needed help. 

P.S. what I found when trying to find a solution which made my day:
