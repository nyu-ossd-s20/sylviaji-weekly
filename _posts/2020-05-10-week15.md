title: Week 15 Final Thoughts

## What I’ve learned
This week is the final week of OSSD, and it is hard to believe my last semester at NYU is ending already. I decided to sign up for this course after looking at the course websites from previous semesters, and I was excited about the opportunities to meet with all the guest speakers who have a background in open source. Now as the end of the course is approaching, I can say that the talks given by our amazing guest speakers this semester did not let me down, but I’ve also gained much more from the course.  For example, knowledge of Git. I noticed there will be many Git practices in this class during registration, but I did not take that into account because I thought I was familiar with Git already. It turned out that I knew nothing (not really, but close), and I learned a lot more about Git branches and rebase.

Licensing was another thing I’ve learned a lot about in this class. Before taking this class, I did not realize that licensing is such a huge thing in open source and many other areas. Now, when I need some images from the internet, I will use Google’s advanced search and make sure that the images are free to use or share in order to avoid any possible issues. When I see some cool project on Github, I will also check its license and see if it is open source. 

In my very first blog post of the semester, I wrote that I’ve never considered contributing to open source before. But now, the open source world is no longer mysterious to me. By doing the project evaluations, I learned how to tell whether an open source project will be a great one to contribute to, and more importantly, I’ve also learned what the workflow of contributing to open source is like by working on the final project. I would say that this is my biggest gain from the class.
