## Group Stand-Up Reports 2.0

This Monday we did the second round of group stand-up reports. We provided some updates on our contributions & the interactions with the community, and also what we expect to accomplish before the presentation. Charlie mentioned our attempt at this [API restructuring](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues/625) issue, and Joanna gave the suggestion to always leave a comment before trying to work on the issue. We will be doing our project presentation on May 11, and I hope that we can make more contributions by then.

## Lemmy Progress

### Docker Development

### React is Hard :(

### Lemmy Cake Day!

### Translations

Nishant raised an issue about adding a new language to Weblate, and the maintainer was very helpful. I’m also thinking about suggesting more languages on Weblate. I just suggested traditional Chinese, and I think I should be able to finish all the translation work soon given that the progress for simplified Chinese is now 100%. I’d also like to suggest Korean, but I’m not quite sure if my Korean is good enough to do the translation (with some help from Google Translate, maybe…?) Anyway I will try to finish the translation for traditional Chinese first!
