## Guest Speaks
In Monday’s lecture, we had a discussion on what we think about the talks delivered by our guest speakers. Someone brought up a really interesting point of how the career paths of Kevin and Gil differ. Kevin was the type of developer that people would often think of a “open-source hacker”, and when companies realized they need open source people on their teams, he became a very desirable hire for the companies who want his expertise developed from contributing to open source projects. On the other hand, Gil has a more formal path into the software engineering and corporate world and then started to get involved with the open source world. 
What they have in common is their greatest passion for open source today despite how different their career paths are, and I really enjoyed their stories with open source.
